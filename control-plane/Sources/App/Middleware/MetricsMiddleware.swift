/// Emits RED metrics (request count + duration) for every HTTP request, so the
/// whole API surface is observable without per-route instrumentation.
///
/// Labels are kept low-cardinality on purpose: `route` is the *matched route
/// pattern* (`/api/vms/:vmID`), never the concrete path, so a million VMs still
/// map to one series; unmatched requests (genuine 404s with no route) fall back
/// to `unmatched`. The counter buckets status by class (`2xx`/`4xx`/`5xx`),
/// while the duration timer carries only method + route.
///
/// Like `RequestLoggingMiddleware`, the ultimate client-visible status on the
/// error path is derived from the thrown error rather than a `Response`, since
/// `ErrorMiddleware` downstream turns the error into a response only after it
/// propagates back through here. `request.route` is populated by the router
/// during `next.respond`, so it is read after the call completes.
///
/// Emission goes through the swift-metrics facade, which is a no-op unless
/// OpenTelemetry is bootstrapped (see `Telemetry`), so this costs nothing when
/// metrics are disabled.
