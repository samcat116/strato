/// Adds standard HTTP security headers to every response — including error
/// responses, since `ErrorMiddleware` has already turned thrown errors into a
/// `Response` by the time it propagates back through here.
///
/// Registered as one of the outermost middlewares (see `configure.swift`) so the
/// headers land on API JSON, static assets, and error pages alike.
///
/// `Content-Security-Policy` is only applied when the handler hasn't already set
/// one, so endpoints that need a looser policy (e.g. `/api/docs`, which loads
/// Swagger UI from a CDN) can opt out by supplying their own.
///
/// The default same-origin CSP is *not* applied to `text/html` responses. When
/// `FileMiddleware` serves the bundled Next.js frontend from `Public/`, those
/// pages carry inline hydration scripts (`self.__next_f.push(...)`) that a
/// `default-src 'self'` policy with no script nonce/hash would block, leaving the
/// UI stuck on its loading shell. HTML pages either ship their own CSP
/// (`/api/docs`) or rely on `X-Frame-Options`/`nosniff` here plus the CSP set by
/// the production frontend container; the strict default is reserved for the API
/// and static assets.
///
/// HSTS is gated on `enableHSTS` because `Strict-Transport-Security` must only be
/// sent over HTTPS; sending it from a plaintext dev server would pin browsers to
/// an https:// origin that doesn't exist locally.
