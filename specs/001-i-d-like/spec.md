# Feature Specification: Skaffold and Helm Integration for Development

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-d-like`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I'd like to switch from a docker-compose file for local testing to a fully integrated setup using Skaffold that uses the helm chart. This means we can use the same helm chart used for production deployments for development"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: Replace docker-compose with Skaffold+Helm for development
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, DevOps engineers
   ‚Üí Actions: local development, testing, deployment
   ‚Üí Data: application configuration, environment settings
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain development workflow efficiency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which services currently in docker-compose need Helm chart coverage?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there specific development-only services that shouldn't be in production Helm charts?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: developer runs local environment using Skaffold
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Development environment parity with production
   ‚Üí Seamless developer experience
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Development environment, Helm charts, Skaffold configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties about current service architecture"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for development team and infrastructure stakeholders

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Strato platform, I want to run a local development environment that mirrors production deployment configuration so that I can catch environment-specific issues early and have confidence that my changes will work in production.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have the Strato codebase checked out locally, **When** I run the development environment setup command, **Then** all services start successfully using the same Helm chart configuration as production
2. **Given** I make code changes to the control plane or agent, **When** I save the files, **Then** the development environment automatically rebuilds and redeploys the affected services
3. **Given** I need to test with different configuration values, **When** I modify development-specific values, **Then** the environment reflects those changes without affecting the production Helm chart structure
4. **Given** I want to debug a service, **When** I access logs or connect debugging tools, **Then** I can do so as easily as with the current docker-compose setup

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Helm chart changes are made that affect both development and production?
- How does the system handle service dependencies during incremental rebuilds?
- What occurs if a developer's local environment configuration conflicts with the Helm chart requirements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Development environment MUST use the same Helm chart structure as production deployments
- **FR-002**: System MUST support automatic rebuilding and redeployment when source code changes
- **FR-003**: Developers MUST be able to start the full local environment with a single command
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide equivalent functionality to current docker-compose setup for local development
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow development-specific configuration overrides without modifying production chart values
- **FR-006**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which services currently in docker-compose need Helm chart coverage - control-plane, agent, database, Permify, networking services?]
- **FR-007**: Development environment MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there development-only services (like test databases, mock services) that shouldn't be in production Helm charts?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain developer productivity by providing fast iteration cycles
- **FR-009**: System MUST support debugging and log access equivalent to current docker-compose capabilities

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Development Environment**: Local running instance of Strato services using Helm charts, supports hot-reloading and debugging
- **Helm Chart**: Production-ready deployment configuration that can be customized for development use
- **Skaffold Configuration**: Defines build, deploy, and development workflow automation for the local environment
- **Service Dependencies**: Relationships between control plane, agent, database, authorization, and networking components
