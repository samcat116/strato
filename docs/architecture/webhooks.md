# Webhooks

User-managed event notifications (issue #559): organizations subscribe webhook
endpoints to typed platform events, and the control plane delivers signed JSON
payloads reliably through a transactional outbox. This closes the automation
loop — external systems no longer need to poll operations or resources.

This subsystem supersedes the operator-level `AUDIT_WEBHOOK_URL` audit export
for product use; that backend remains as an ops trail export.

## Event catalog

Events are a small typed enum (`WebhookEventType`) with wire-stable `type`
strings:

| Type | Fires when |
| ---- | ---------- |
| `operation.completed` | An async resource operation (VM or sandbox create/start/stop/delete/reboot/…) succeeds |
| `operation.failed` | An async resource operation fails (agent error or the stuck-operation sweep) |
| `vm.state_changed` | A VM's observed status transitions (agent reports, drift, loss) |
| `agent.connected` | An agent registers its WebSocket connection |
| `agent.disconnected` | An agent unregisters, its socket closes, or its heartbeat goes stale |
| `quota.threshold_exceeded` | A workload admission pushes a quota pool across 80% or 100% of its limit |
| `webhook.test` | The "send test event" endpoint (not subscribable; always delivered to the target subscription) |

Every payload is a stable envelope:

```json
{
  "id": "8f7c…",                    // event id, shared across the fan-out — dedupe on this
  "type": "operation.completed",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-22T18:03:12Z",
  "organizationId": "…",
  "projectId": "…",                  // null for org-level events (agent presence)
  "resource": { "kind": "virtual_machine", "id": "…", "name": "web-1" },
  "data": { "operationId": "…", "operationKind": "boot", "status": "succeeded" }
}
```

Growing the catalog is one new enum case plus an emit call at the semantic
moment (image import finished, snapshot completed, floating IP attached, …).

## Subscriptions

`WebhookSubscription` rows are org-scoped configuration (managed under
**Settings → Webhooks** in the UI, or `/api/organizations/:orgID/webhooks`):
target URL, selected event types (empty = all), an optional project scope
filter, an active flag, and a per-subscription signing secret. Org members can
read subscription configuration; org admins mutate, and delivery history is
admin-only too — delivery rows carry frozen event payloads (resource names,
error strings) from any project in the organization (the same
`OrganizationAccessService` Cedar gates as SSF streams).

- **Secrets** are generated server-side (`whsec_…`), stored encrypted at rest
  by `SecretsEncryptionService`, and shown exactly once — in the create and
  rotate-secret responses.
- **SSRF**: target URLs are validated by `SSRFGuard` at create/update *and*
  again by the delivery sweep before every POST, so a DNS record that later
  rebinds to an internal address is still refused.

## Transactional outbox

Request handlers and agent-report processing never fire HTTP. Emitting an
event means inserting `webhook_deliveries` rows — one per matching active
subscription, all sharing the event's id — on the same `Database` handle as
the state change that produced the event:

- `operation.completed`/`operation.failed` are enqueued inside
  `ResourceOperation.completeIfPending`, the one funnel every completion path
  (agent response, post-202 task, stuck-operation sweep) goes through. The
  status flip and the outbox insert commit in one transaction, and the
  "only the winner completes" guard means the event is enqueued exactly once.
- `quota.threshold_exceeded` is enqueued inside the quota admission
  transaction (`QuotaEnforcementService.reserveWorkload`), comparing the
  post-resync baseline against the post-admission reservation so only a
  *crossing* fires, not every admission above 80%.
- VM state changes and agent presence are enqueued fire-and-forget next to
  the status writes (`WebhookEvents.emit` logs failures rather than breaking
  observed-state bookkeeping).

The payload JSON is frozen at enqueue time, so what was true at the semantic
moment is what gets delivered, regardless of later mutations.

## Delivery sweep

`WebhookDeliveryService` runs a periodic loop on every replica (armed by
`WebhookDeliveryLifecycleHandler`, default every 15s), made cluster-singleton
per pass by the `lock:sweep:webhook_delivery` Valkey lock — the same pattern
as the audit-retention and SSF poll sweeps. Each pass drains due pending rows
(oldest first, batched):

- **Signing**: `X-Strato-Signature: t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex hmac>` where the
  HMAC is SHA-256 over `"<t>.<body>"` with the subscription secret. Consumers
  recompute it and should reject stale timestamps. `X-Strato-Event-Id`,
  `X-Strato-Event-Type`, and `X-Strato-Delivery-Id` headers ride along.
- **Retry**: non-2xx or transport errors back off exponentially (30s doubling
  to a 1h cap); after 8 attempts the delivery is `dead` and only a manual
  redeliver revives it. Requests time out after 10s.
- **Auto-disable**: the subscription tracks `failingSince`, the start of its
  current unbroken failure streak (any success clears it). Once the streak is
  older than `WEBHOOK_AUTO_DISABLE_DAYS` (default 3), the subscription is
  deactivated with a `disabledReason` the UI surfaces; re-activating clears
  the bookkeeping.
- **History**: terminal deliveries are kept 7 days as browsable per-
  subscription history (status, attempts, last response code, frozen payload)
  with manual redeliver and a "send test event" endpoint.

## Multi-replica properties

Reliability falls out of the same machinery as the rest of the control plane:
PostgreSQL is the only source of truth (any replica can enqueue — it is just
a row insert in the caller's transaction), and delivery is **at-least-once**
— a crash between POST and the success write replays the delivery once the
claim lease lapses. Consumers dedupe on the event id.

Concurrent drainers are safe by construction, not by the sweep lock alone:
each pass **claims** its batch with a single atomic
`UPDATE … SET next_attempt_at = now() + lease … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED …
RETURNING`, so a pass that outlives the lock TTL and an overlapping tick on
another replica claim disjoint rows. Within a pass, POSTs fan out with
bounded concurrency so a few timing-out endpoints cannot head-of-line-block
healthy ones. The sweep lock remains as an optimization that keeps idle
replicas from running the claim query every tick.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_ENABLED` | `true` (off under tests) | Arm the delivery sweep |
| `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `15` | Sweep cadence (worst-case added latency) |
| `WEBHOOK_AUTO_DISABLE_DAYS` | `3` | Continuous-failure window before auto-disable |
